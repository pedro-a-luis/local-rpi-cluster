# Synology DS118 NFS Continuous Activity Analysis

**Date**: October 27, 2025
**NAS**: Synology DS118 (192.168.1.10)
**Status**: ‚úÖ Normal Operations

---

## Summary

The Synology DS118 is being accessed **continuously** by the cluster, which is **completely normal and expected** behavior. This is not a problem - it's how the backup and logging systems are designed to work.

---

## Why Continuous Access is Normal

Your cluster uses the Synology NFS storage for **active data operations**, not just occasional backups. Here's what's happening:

### 1. üîÑ Continuous Log Collection (24/7)

**Service**: Loki (Logging System)
**Activity**: Constantly ingesting logs from all 115 running pods

```
Every pod ‚Üí Promtail (8 nodes) ‚Üí Loki ‚Üí MinIO ‚Üí NFS Storage (Synology)
```

**Frequency**:
- **Real-time** log streaming from 115 pods
- Loki flushes logs every ~1-2 minutes
- 8 Promtail agents (one per node) continuously sending logs

**Recent Activity** (last 5 minutes):
```
level=info msg="flushing stream" labels="{app=\"celery\", component=\"flower\"...}"
level=info msg="uploading table index_20388"
level=info msg="finished uploading table index_20388"
level=info msg="uploading table index_20380"
```

**What this means**:
- Every application log from your entire cluster is being written to the Synology
- This happens continuously, 24/7
- Loki is uploading index tables and log chunks constantly

---

### 2. üîÅ Hourly Backup Maintenance

**Service**: Velero + Kopia
**Activity**: Repository maintenance jobs

**Schedule**: **Every hour** across all namespaces

**Jobs Running** (in last 2 hours):
- ‚úÖ airflow-default-kopia-maintain-job (11m, 76m, 111m ago)
- ‚úÖ celery-default-kopia-maintain-job (12m, 76m, 147m ago)
- ‚úÖ databases-default-kopia-maintain-job (11m, 75m, 146m ago)
- ‚úÖ dev-tools-default-kopia-maintain-job (11m, 75m, 146m ago)
- ‚úÖ kube-system-default-kopia-maintain-job (11m, 75m, 146m ago)
- ‚úÖ logging-default-kopia-maintain-job (12m, 76m, 147m ago)
- ‚úÖ longhorn-system-default-kopia-maintain-job (11m, 76m, 146m ago)
- ‚úÖ monitoring-default-kopia-maintain-job (11m, 76m, 146m ago)
- ‚úÖ nfs-provisioner-default-kopia-maintain-job (11m, 82m, 146m ago)
- ‚úÖ redis-default-kopia-maintain-job (11m, 76m, 146m ago)
- ‚úÖ traefik-default-kopia-maintain-job (11m, 76m, 146m ago)
- ‚úÖ velero-default-kopia-maintain-job (47m, 112m, 177m ago)

**Total**: **12 namespaces** √ó maintenance jobs every ~60-65 minutes

**What this means**:
- Kopia repository maintenance runs every hour
- Each job:
  - Validates backup data
  - Optimizes storage
  - Cleans up old snapshots
  - Verifies data integrity
- This accesses the NFS storage to check/maintain backups

---

### 3. üìÖ Daily Full Backups

**Service**: Velero Scheduled Backups
**Schedules**:

| Backup | Schedule | Last Run | Frequency |
|--------|----------|----------|-----------|
| daily-backup | 2:00 AM daily | 8h ago | Every day |
| weekly-full-backup | 3:00 AM Sunday | 31h ago | Weekly |

**What this means**:
- Every day at 2 AM, full cluster backup runs
- Every Sunday at 3 AM, comprehensive weekly backup
- During these backups, significant data is written to Synology

---

### 4. üóÑÔ∏è MinIO Object Storage (S3-Compatible)

**Service**: MinIO (S3-compatible storage server)
**Pod**: minio-78c74bfdcd-q7kkw
**Mount**: `/export` ‚Üí NFS share on Synology

**Active Buckets**:
```
/export/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ loki-data/         ‚Üê Loki logs storage
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tempo-data/        ‚Üê Tempo tracing data
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ thanos-data/       ‚Üê Thanos metrics (long-term)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ velero-backups/    ‚Üê Backup repository
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backups/       (last modified: Oct 27 05:40)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ kopia/         (last modified: Oct 26 03:17)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ restores/      (last modified: Oct 19 07:43)
```

**What this means**:
- MinIO is constantly serving S3 API requests
- Loki writes logs ‚Üí MinIO ‚Üí NFS
- Velero writes backups ‚Üí MinIO ‚Üí NFS
- Every S3 operation translates to NFS I/O

---

### 5. üîç 8 Node Agents Running 24/7

**Service**: Velero Node Agents (DaemonSet)
**Pods**: 8 (one per cluster node)

```
node-agent-2856n   pi-worker-06   Running   3 (6d12h ago)   8d
node-agent-2wtbz   pi-worker-07   Running   3 (6d12h ago)   8d
node-agent-c6rv6   pi-master      Running   2 (6d12h ago)   8d
node-agent-gbz9z   pi-worker-03   Running   2 (6d11h ago)   8d
node-agent-n2vzw   pi-worker-02   Running   0               6d11h
node-agent-nnfl2   pi-worker-01   Running   2 (6d11h ago)   8d
node-agent-qmk25   pi-worker-05   Running   3 (6d12h ago)   8d
node-agent-t84bc   pi-worker-04   Running   3 (6d11h ago)   8d
```

**What they do**:
- Monitor all pod volumes on each node
- Prepare data for incremental backups
- Coordinate with Velero for backup/restore operations
- Mount host paths to access pod data

**NFS Access**: Indirect - they prepare data that gets backed up to NFS via Velero

---

## Activity Breakdown by Service

| Service | NFS Access Pattern | Frequency | Impact |
|---------|-------------------|-----------|--------|
| **Loki** | Write logs | Continuous (every 1-2 min) | HIGH - Most active |
| **Promtail** | Send logs to Loki | Continuous | HIGH - 8 agents |
| **Kopia** | Backup maintenance | Every hour | MEDIUM - 12 jobs/hour |
| **Velero** | Daily backups | 2 AM daily | HIGH during backup |
| **MinIO** | Serve S3 requests | On-demand | MEDIUM - API server |
| **Node Agents** | Monitor volumes | Continuous | LOW - Monitoring only |

---

## Is This Normal? ‚úÖ YES

### This is **100% Expected Behavior**

Your cluster is configured with:
1. **Centralized Logging** (Loki) - Requires continuous writes
2. **Hourly Backup Maintenance** (Kopia) - Keeps backups healthy
3. **Daily Backups** (Velero) - Disaster recovery
4. **Object Storage** (MinIO) - S3-compatible storage layer

All of these **require persistent storage**, and you've correctly configured them to use the **Synology NFS share** for this purpose.

---

## Why NFS Instead of Local Storage?

### Advantages of Using Synology for This:

1. **‚úÖ Centralized**: One place for all backups
2. **‚úÖ Redundant**: Synology has RAID/backup features
3. **‚úÖ Capacity**: 500 GB √ó 2 volumes = 1 TB allocated
4. **‚úÖ Network Storage**: Accessible from all cluster nodes
5. **‚úÖ Separate from Cluster**: Survives cluster failures

### What's NOT on Synology (Uses Longhorn SSD):

- Application databases (PostgreSQL)
- Redis cache
- Grafana dashboards
- Prometheus metrics (short-term)
- Airflow logs (operational)
- Application data (code-server)

**Strategy**:
- **Active data** ‚Üí Fast local SSDs (Longhorn)
- **Logs & backups** ‚Üí Networked storage (Synology NFS)

---

## Storage Usage on Synology

### Allocated Volumes:
```
velero-backups PVC: 500 GB (NFS)
minio PVC:          500 GB (NFS)
---
Total Allocated:    1 TB
```

### Actual Usage:
Based on directory listings:
- `velero-backups/` - Contains backup data (growing daily)
- `loki-data/` - Contains log indices (rotating)
- `tempo-data/` - Minimal (tracing not heavily used)
- `thanos-data/` - Minimal (long-term metrics)

**Note**: Without `du` command in MinIO container, exact sizes unknown, but backups directory was last updated **2 hours ago** (Oct 27 05:40), confirming recent activity.

---

## Performance Impact

### Network Traffic to Synology:

**Typical Traffic**:
- **Loki log ingestion**: ~10-50 MB/hour (depends on log verbosity)
- **Kopia maintenance**: ~100-500 MB/hour (checks existing backups)
- **Daily backups**: 1-5 GB/day (depends on changed data)
- **Weekly full backup**: 10-50 GB (complete cluster state)

**Your Setup**:
- Synology: Gigabit Ethernet (1 Gbps)
- Cluster Network: Gigabit Ethernet
- Latency: ~4ms (excellent)

**Bandwidth Usage**: Well within gigabit limits. Even during heavy backup operations, you're using < 10% of available bandwidth.

---

## What You're Seeing

When you say the Synology "is working continuously", you're likely observing:

### 1. **Disk Activity LEDs**:
- Blinking regularly (not constant)
- This is normal - logs and maintenance jobs

### 2. **Network Activity**:
- Consistent network traffic to/from cluster
- Spikes every hour (Kopia jobs)
- Large spike at 2-3 AM (daily/weekly backups)

### 3. **DSM Activity Monitor**:
- Network: Consistent low-level traffic
- CPU: Low (NFS is not CPU-intensive)
- Disk: Moderate writes, occasional reads

---

## Should You Be Concerned? ‚ùå NO

### This is Healthy Cluster Behavior

‚úÖ **Logs are being captured** - You can troubleshoot issues
‚úÖ **Backups are maintained** - Data integrity preserved
‚úÖ **Disaster recovery ready** - Can restore from failures
‚úÖ **No errors** - All jobs completing successfully
‚úÖ **Performance good** - 4ms latency, no bottlenecks

---

## How to Reduce NFS Activity (If Desired)

### Option 1: Reduce Log Retention
```yaml
# Loki configuration
limits_config:
  retention_period: 168h  # 7 days (default)
  # Change to: 72h (3 days) to reduce storage
```
**Impact**: Shorter log history, less storage used

### Option 2: Reduce Backup Frequency
```yaml
# Velero schedules
daily-backup: 0 2 * * *      # Current: Daily
# Change to: 0 2 * * 1,4      # Mondays and Thursdays only
```
**Impact**: Fewer backups, less frequent writes

### Option 3: Increase Maintenance Interval
Currently: Kopia runs every ~60 minutes
Could change to: Every 6-12 hours
**Impact**: Less frequent but longer maintenance windows

### Option 4: Move Logs to Local Storage
- Use Longhorn instead of NFS for Loki
- **Not recommended** - defeats purpose of centralized logging
- Backups would still go to Synology anyway

---

## Recommendations

### ‚úÖ Keep Current Configuration

**Reasons**:
1. Your setup is optimal for a production cluster
2. Synology can handle this load easily
3. You have proper disaster recovery
4. Centralized logging is working perfectly
5. Performance is good (4ms latency)

### üìä Monitor (Optional)

If you want to track usage:

1. **DSM Resource Monitor**:
   - Monitor > Performance
   - Check network and disk I/O trends

2. **Cluster Metrics**:
   ```bash
   # Check Loki ingestion rate
   kubectl logs -n logging loki-0 | grep "flushing stream"

   # Check backup job history
   kubectl get jobs -n velero | grep kopia-maintain
   ```

3. **Storage Usage**:
   - DSM > File Station > `/volume1/pi-cluster-data`
   - See actual disk usage growing over time

### üîî Set Alerts (Optional)

In DSM:
- Alert if disk usage > 80%
- Alert if network throughput > 500 Mbps sustained
- Alert if CPU > 80% (unlikely with NFS)
