1. **Use descriptive filenames**: `TOPIC-SESSION-DATE.md`
2. **Include metadata**: Date, author, duration, systems affected
3. **Document the problem**: Clear description of the initial issue
4. **Show the process**: Step-by-step troubleshooting narrative
5. **Highlight the solution**: What worked and why
6. **Note lessons learned**: Key takeaways for future reference
7. **Link to related docs**: Connect to relevant official documentation
